To make sure anyone can easily perform the different tasks, we have provisioned a Virtual Machine for each of you.

You'll be able to deploy several Kubernetes clusters on this machine using _Kind_.

_MetalLB_ has been deployed to expose the Load Balancer services you'll create on your Kubernetes clusters.

All the prerequisites have already been deployed on your machine.

## Prerequisites

Have a kubernetes/openshift cluster installed.

You can create one on you local machine using [kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind)
